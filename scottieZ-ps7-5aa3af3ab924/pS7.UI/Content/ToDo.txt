Get a list of links together for classmates, and stuff you like, and ultimately GitHub once we get some stuff posted on there
	make sure the project links dont get redundant in dropdown links, keep them in the portfolio section

Contact Confirmation.. lets figure out how to do this with JS or angular or something so it gives a popup instead of a different view

dont forget to do target: _blank for all the links AND files.. IE resume, etc.

keep an eye on the page flow, taking out the "facts" section made it look a little weird.. may not be a big deal at the end of the day though

maybe take all the a's out of the skills (services..) section. I could see this getting wonky on mobile and it's just kind of misleading in general



need to test contact page once we get it on the DNS

need to do the dropdown stuff at the top, and change the pic on the about page
Fix the image on the about page, change it to something else, or a picture of yourself.
